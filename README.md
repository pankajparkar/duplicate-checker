# Range Maker

## Problem Statement

Create a text input that accepts single, multiple and even a range of numbers and matches the entered
numbers with an already existing array and shows the duplicates, if any, and the final list of unique
numbers.
Eg inputs -> 7000, 6000, 8000-8005.
If a range is entered, or multiple ranges are entered, all the numbers falling between that range/those
ranges have to be considered, matched and displayed.
So to sum it up, if I have an existing array of [7000,7001,7002,7003,7004,7005] in the script and in the text
input I enter 6098-7003, I should be notified that 7000, 7001, 7002, 7003 are duplicates and will be
skipped, with the final list of new additions (2 in this case).
Make sure you think of and handle different test cases, design the notification messages in the most
intuitive and beautiful way you know, and most importantly, perform the validation on the
keypress/keyup of the input box instead of a submit button or blur event.
